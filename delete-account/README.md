# Account and Data Deletion – Sổ Đơn

Sổ Đơn does **not provide user accounts**.

The app works fully offline and does not store user data on any external servers owned or operated by the developer.

## How user data is handled

- All app data is stored locally on the user's device
- Optional backups may be stored in the user's own Google Drive App Data folder
- The developer does not have access to user data

## How to delete your data

Because Sổ Đơn does not have user accounts, there is no account to delete.

Users can delete their data at any time by:

- Deleting data directly within the app
- Uninstalling the app from their device (this removes all local data)
- Deleting the app’s data from Google Drive (for Google Drive backups)

No data is retained by the developer.
